Module to predict the cosmic shear signal (2-point correlation function) using input cosmological parameters and do proper null hypothesis test.

The matter power spectrum is calculated using the CLASS package (https://github.com/lshuns/class_public)

The intrinsic redshift distribution and the covariance matrices is available on request.
